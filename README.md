## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- HTML
- CSS


### What I learned

- Finally getting back into the swing of things. Doing a project like this was nice for me to relearn all of things I had forgotten. HTML inside of React was a great refresher. Learning more about using CSS and using flexbox to achieve part of this solution.
